            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project delves into statistics about liver cancer mortality rates globally, regionally, and subregionally. The aim is to find correlations between liver cancer mortality and other variables such as healthcare spending and alcohol consumption. The project utilizes age-standardized mortality rates to eliminate age bias, providing an accurate comparison across different populations and regions.</p>
            Gernerally, to produce the charts attached, data were extracted, cleaned using pandas on Google Colab Notebooks, then as a last step, created charts oncharts were created using Vega-Lite.

                <h2>Section 1: Liver Cancer Mortality Rates by Country</h2>
                <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This section analyzes liver cancer mortality trends across various regions in 2022, using Age-Standardized Mortality Rates (ASR) per 100,000 people for both sexes. The goal is to identify regional differences and explore potential influencing factors.</p>
                <p><strong>Data:</strong> Liver cancer Mortality Rates by Country <a href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/en/dataviz/bars-compare-populations?mode=cancer&group_populations=1&multiple_populations=1&types=1&populations=250_826&group_crc=0&key=asr&sort_by=value1">Data</a>, sourced from WHO, covers 12 countries across six regions.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Finding up-to-date data and accounting for varying regional classifications were challenges. Additionally, the dataset lacked information on socioeconomic, healthcare, or lifestyle factors.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Countries like Mongolia and Egypt show high mortality rates, while Switzerland and Germany have lower rates, indicating regional disparities. This could be due to gaps in healthcare access.</p>

                <h2>Section 2: Liver Cancer Mortality Rates of UK vs. Germany</h2>
                <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This section compares liver cancer mortality rates between the UK and Germany, highlighting the influence of their healthcare systems. The UK has a publicly funded system (NHS), while Germany has a universal multi-payer system.</p>
                <p><strong>Data:</strong> The dataset includes UK Liver Cancer Mortality <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/liver-cancer/mortality#heading-Two">Data</a>(1971-2017)</p>
                <p>and Germany Liver Cancer Mortality <a href="https://www.krebsdaten.de/Krebs/EN/Database/databasequery_step1_node.html">Data</a> (1999-2023)</p>
                <p>Cleaning and merging the UK and Germany timeseries data were done using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y2FWTc2BS0IVEinPTyZEAucJ9hU0El00?usp=sharing">Google Colab Notebook</a></p>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The different time periods for the UK and Germany data complicate direct comparisons. Additionally, lifestyle, demographics, and public health initiatives are not captured in the data.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> The UK has seen a consistent increase in mortality rates, while Germany's rates have remained stable.</p>
                <p> The data suggests that healthcare systems, population aging, and lifestyle changes in the UK may explain the rising mortality rates, while Germany's system may be more stabilizing.</p>

                <h2>Section 3: Health Expenditure vs. Liver Cancer Mortality Rate</h2>
                <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This section explores the relationship between health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and liver cancer mortality rates in the UK and Germany.</p>
                <p><strong>Data:</strong> The datasets include liver cancer mortality rates and Health Expenditure as a % of GDP <a href="https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?lc=en&df[ds]=DisseminateArchiveDMZ&df[id]=DF_DP_LIVE&df[ag]=OECD&av=true&pd=1972%2C2024&dq=DEU%2BGBR%2BOECD.HEALTHEXP...A&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&vw=tb&lb=bt">Data</a> for both countries over several decades.</p>
                <p>Cleaning Health Expenditure Data was done using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t0RFrH2WqpyHRr5sUiPmfo3X2WIgv-qC?usp=sharing">Google Colab Notebook</a></p>
                <p>Merging Health Expenditure and Mortality Rates was done using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cEs693Sc0FBqyTNZ-lW-D4xcHymWXa9P?usp=sharing">Google Colab Notebook</a></p>
                <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Inconsistent reporting periods and confounding factors like healthcare access, lifestyle, and interventions complicate analysis.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Both countries show an increase in health expenditure, but the UK shows a more pronounced increase in mortality rates.</p>
                <p>Increased health expenditure correlates with higher mortality rates, but other factors like healthcare efficiency, lifestyle, and prevention programs also play a role.</p>

             <p>  In conclusion, this project has provided a comprehensive analysis of liver cancer mortality rates across various countries and regions, while examining factors such as healthcare expenditure, alcohol consumption, and regional variations. </p>
             <p>    Despite challenges like data inconsistency and limited time spans, the findings highlight significant disparities in liver cancer mortality rates. </p>
            <p>    The UK's rising mortality rates contrast with Germany's stability, suggesting that healthcare systems and lifestyle factors play critical roles. </p>
              <p>    Further research is essential to explore the intricate relationships among factors influencing liver cancer mortality; such as socioeconomic background, human behavior, surrounding environment, inherited genetics, and many more. This will help identify targeted prevention strategies. </p>
