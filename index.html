            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                At the economics festival, a key discussion addressed whether GDP growth correlates with decreased sustainability due to increased production. 
                To investigate this, I analyzed U.S. data on industrial production and CO2 emissions from 1973 to 2022.
                The data shows that while industrial production significantly increased during this period, CO2 emissions actually decreased. 
                This suggests that GDP growth does not inherently lead to lower sustainability.
                A possible explanation is the advancement of technology in industrial processes, allowing for greater output with reduced environmental impact. 
                This challenges the assumption that economic growth must compromise sustainability.

                The tast is to replicate a misguiding published chart, and then improve it. 
                A photo of the Original Chart is displayed along with the one I replicated, followed by the mofidifed chart I did
                Modifications basically included changing the scale of the bar chart in order to have a well visualized bar, having the bar length reflecting the numebr of likes. 
                It also highlighted the top bar alond with its axis label to point out to the largest number of likes. 
                Additionally, I changed the color of the bars from orange to blue.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I chose to scrape data about the healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP per country.
                Here's the wikipedia link from which I got the data:
                "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_spending_as_percent_of_gross_domestic_product_(GDP)_by_country"
                Then I normalised the data into a long format using google colab: 
                "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YB_3v3Wyc9ai-DkVp6HV0imjL2uZuH09?usp=sharing", then I exported it into csv file.
                Afterwards I created a chart on Vega-Light using the scraped data, which is displayed below
