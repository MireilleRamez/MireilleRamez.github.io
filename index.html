            <h2>Section 3: Week 3 Portfolio Task: Economics Festival Topic Discussion </h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                At the economics festival, a key discussion addressed whether GDP growth correlates with decreased sustainability due to increased production. 
                To investigate this, I analyzed U.S. data on industrial production and CO2 emissions from 1973 to 2022.
                The data shows that while industrial production significantly increased during this period, CO2 emissions actually decreased. 
                This suggests that GDP growth does not inherently lead to lower sustainability.
                A possible explanation is the advancement of technology in industrial processes, allowing for greater output with reduced environmental impact. 
                This challenges the assumption that economic growth must compromise sustainability.
